# Portfolio â€¢ Side Project
## Why
* Two careers, two sets of projects and achievements: how to link the two?
* Replace [my old website](http://camelia.strikingly.com/) and give it a new fresh look
* Stop depending on a third party website like Strikingly â€”> some professional work is needed.

Letâ€™s get some more visibility ðŸš€

## What
A clean minimalist website with two main parts:
#### Product Management â€” short paragraph at the top on main missions & skills
	* List of projects achieved with visuals 
	* Short impacting sentence about it
#### Social Media Management â€” short paragraph at the top on main missions & skills
	* List of all clients that Iâ€™ve worked for
	* Testimonials if I can find some
	* Short sentence about  the work that has been done

## How
See with Maxence the best way to go about it.
